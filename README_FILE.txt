# C# Assessment

The created tool "Weapons Creator Tool" is designed to assist programmers in the developemnt of weapons for their games. The project looks through creating, saving and loading files of .xml format for weapons.

## 1. Weapons Creator Tool Use

The tool is designed to help beginning programmers with a basic idea of creating an item. This item created by programmer will be of type weapon, allowing them to grasp the concept of creating, and setting stats for a weapon. They may create their own weapon and attributes, which they may use in their own game, for their own purposes.


## 2.0 Creating A Weapon

The tool is very user friendly, and will assist the user in creating their weapon with attributes. They will start by drawing their representation of a weapon, then adding attributes to it. Once they have finalized their weapon, then will click on "Add Weapon", and their weapon will be saved. This will be further explained in the 2.1 header.

## 2.1 Saving A Weapon

The created image will be saved as .PNG and the entire loadout including the image path, will be saved in .xml format. The file will be accessible through the Weapon List present in the main menu, allowing the user to search, or find then load their weapon. The loading of files is further explained in the 2.2 header.

## 2.2 Loading A Weapon

The main menu screen of the tool, brings an interactable weapons list interface, whihc allows the player to load in their weapon. This weapon will be loaded through the reading of the .xml format, opening the contents and loading it through by "Name:", "Weapon Attribute: " and "Weapon Image: ".

## 2.3 Editing A Weapon

The fully created weapon can be edited through the main menu 'Weapons Editor'. This allows user to change the attribute of the weapon created and the weapon name, withgout manually editting the .xml file. When changes have been made through the tool the weapon will now store the new value.

## 3.0 Tests Performed

All tests have been recorded in seperate txt file, please refer to "Tool Application Test".

## 4.0 Tests Performed Evaluation

The tests performed were of competency, and the tool works to its needed extent of purpose. The tool is able to create,save, and load the weapon of the user's desire with no errors. Things to consider for future creation of tools, include adding pre-created images of guns, and more attributes.
